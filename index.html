<p>Hey, and welcome to my page! I started this new habit of blogging 2 years ago and was 
hooked ever since ha-ha. Yes, at 24 years young I'm here to share the wisdom that God has 
given me. I am mostly relating to single moms. You guys are my target to help and speak 
out to.

Coming from experience, I have grown a passion for wanting to help be a resource or 
information guide. Wether it be clothes, shoes, blankets, toys, strollers, you name 
it! Even just to get and seek informational and resource assistance.</p>
